##Story

An esteemed professor lectures to his class on the topic of groupthink. He presents some opinions on the subject, only to violate them in a bizzare manner.

##The Making of "Groupthink"
"Groupthink" was the first film we made as a club, created as a submission for the [2017 Film Riot 1-minute film contest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH0nPEx0JaU). We spent a while brainstorming ideas, but blitzed through the shooting in about an hour! To achieve the twist ending effect, we had Patrick sit in each seat while we held a green screen behind him. Then, we isolated each shot, which involved a bit of rotoscoping due to poor lighting, and composited them. The final shot is far from perfect, but it sold the effect.
