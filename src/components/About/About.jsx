            <p>HUFA, founded in 2017, is dedicated to facilitating video production at Harvard via club-wide film projects, educational workshops, feedback sessions among other programming. Early ideation for the club began in 2016 and we were approved as a provisional recognized student organization in the Fall of 2017. We are steadily entering <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3jlDUCIFtE">film competitions</a>&nbsp;and planning our first 48-hour Film Festival for the Arts First Weekend this Spring. We are continually seeking sponsorship to grow and support our up-and-coming club. If youâ€™re a student, company, or anyone interested in the future of filmmaking, please get in touch!</p>
